                    Digital School Solution (DSS) is a concept that captures the vision of digitalizing a school’s learning and management 
                    system to equip students with 21st century competencies and skill sets. The world is changing rapidly and skill sets 
                    needed are also revolving. Traditional schools that are not equip to incorporate 21st century competencies and skill 
                    sets will no longer be enough to support the increasingly diverse and innovation-oriented societies of the future.

                            computer + console and other visual equipment that enables teachers to display e-content for teaching 
                            and learning in a developing school environment. This basic core requirement allows a school to rise

                            into the 21st-century education. Each school has their unique DNA of competencies based on their history, ICT Master Plans, and curriculum. Eduspec 
                            recognizes this valuable school culture in providing the best solution for the school campus and beyond to reach the requirements of all stakeholders.

                            The Digital School Solutionis truly an integration solution that scales to the Information and Communication Technology(ICT) infrastructural growth

                            choice of ICT tools to be used in the classroom, which results to retaining the core purpose and mission of the school – teaching and learning comes 
                            first.

                            Digital School Solution 3.0 embraces the value of school pedagogies in the curriculum to universally select the right digital tools or features for 
                            teachers to independently create content that have been either translated or transformed from core curriculum. This is the true value in harnessing 
                            education technologies moving towards the 21st Century Competencies in teaching with innovative pedagogies. This approach will complement how digital 
                            natives (students) can fully exploit their individual learning styles with various engagement methods.

                <p class="leading-normal text-justify">
                    Robotics serves education in many ways. The everyday relevance of robotic systems – smart phones, autonomous cars, 
                    Internet‐connected appliances, telemedicine, and countless other applications – provides a natural hook for l
                    essons. Given the disruptive effects automation has had on jobs and the economy, robotics itself is also a valuable 
                    area of study. The process of developing robotic solutions provides a rich and meaningful context for engaging 
                    students in CT practices and CS content, including work‐related 21st century skills. Robotics scenarios can also 
                    be used to contextualize other STEM concepts. Ultimately, the “brains” of robotic systems are driven not only by 
                    the bits of steel, silicon, and data within them, but by the CS and Computational Thinking skills of the developers 
                    who design and program them – higher‐order problem‐solving skills that might be best developed when conducting 
                    authentic inquiry.
