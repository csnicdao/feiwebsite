                            Through the evolution of Digital School Solutions 1 and 2, Eduspec has the momentum of professional experience and knowledge to help schools incubate a customer learning environment solution. That solution not only helps them sustain through time, but also allows them to differentiate as an institution into the 21st-century education. Each school has their unique DNA of competencies based on their history, ICT Master Plans, and curriculum. Eduspec recognizes this valuable school culture in providing the best solution for the school campus and beyond, to reach the requirements of all stakeholders.

                            The Digital School Solution is truly an integration solution that scales to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructural growth of the school, while teacher capacity building is the main focus of the Digital School environment.  Teaching methodologies and approaches steer the choice of ICT tools to be used in the classroom, which results to retaining the core purpose and mission of the school – teaching and learning comes first.

                            Digital School Solution 3.0 embraces the value of school pedagogies in the curriculum to universally select the right digital tools or features for teachers to independently create content that have been either translated or transformed from core curriculum. This is the true value in harnessing 
                            education technologies moving towards the 21st Century Competencies in teaching with innovative pedagogies. This approach will complement how digital natives (students) can fully exploit their individual learning styles with various engagement methods.
