                <p class="leading-normal text-justify">
                    Robotics serves education in many ways. The everyday relevance of robotic systems – smart phones, autonomous cars, Internet‐connected appliances, telemedicine, and countless other applications – provides a natural hook for lessons. Given the disruptive effects automation has had on jobs and the economy, robotics itself is also a valuable area of study. The process of developing robotic solutions provides a rich and meaningful context for engaging students in CT practices and CS content, including work‐related 21st century skills. Robotics scenarios can also be used to contextualize other STEM concepts. Ultimately, the “brains” of robotic systems are driven not only by the bits of steel, silicon, and data within them, but by the CS and Computational Thinking skills of the developers who design and program them – higher‐order problem‐solving skills that are best developed when conducting authentic inquiry.

                    Elementary and middle school is the most formative time in a young student's life. The best way to instill a lifelong interest in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) is to provide a fun, engaging, and hands-on opportunity to explore and experience it for themselves.

                    First Eduspec brings you the new learning system called, “Robotics Learning Solution”. It is equipped with an effective learning tool and multimedia aid which are proven to be very effective to students’ STEM learning. Providing an exclusive and advance education in the basics of engineering technology and literacy at primary and secondary schools will help students understand and appreciate the subjects integrated to Robotics. 
                    <br><br>
                    This was proven true as envisioned by the Philippine Government under the Department of Education in provisioning for the career tracks in Academics towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning. Therefore, providing an exclusive and advance education in the basics of engineering technology and literacy at primary and secondary schools will help students understand the physics of functionality and this be able to design simple machines and devices, and subsequently solve specific problems in the context of real situations.
                    <br><br>
                    Exposing the students to robotics learning tools  in as simple as assembling robotics parts, writing programs from the computer and downloading into the robot, thereby animating the robot to perform activities programmed by the user.   First Eduspec have started participating in innovative Robotics events from classroom solutions to platforms like Nationwide Junior Robothon and International Competition spearheaded by Eduspec Malaysia and The Digital Youth Award- Robotics for Children.  Robotics Education is now growing fast in Asian countries like China, Singapore, Indonesia and now in the Philippines.
